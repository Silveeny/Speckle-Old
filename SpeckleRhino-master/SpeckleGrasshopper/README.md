# SpeckleGrasshopper

The Speckle Grasshopper Components (Sender &amp; Receiver)

## Getting Started

SpeckleGrasshopper has a number of dependent projects. You'll need to make sure that they're all cloned into the same directory.

* [SpeckleGrasshopper](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleGrasshopper) (that's _this_ repository)
* [SpeckleAccountManager](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleAccountManager)
* [SpeckleCore](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleCore)
* [SpeckleRhinoConverter](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleRhinoConverter)
* [SpeckleUserDataUtils](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleUserDataUtils)

Next, run `script/boostrap.bat` to grab all the nuget dependencies required to compile SpeckleGrasshopper.

Finally, build `SpeckleGrasshopper.sln`!
