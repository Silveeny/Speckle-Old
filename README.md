# Speckle-Old
 This is an old usage of Speckle and a modified fork from their website for tests i made.
 For more information, please look at www.speckle.com - this is a very outdated build using some of their old implementation with Rhino that I tried to restore.

Small demo I made - it is in the gif file and it is pretty long. I'd suggest opening it with a video player.
